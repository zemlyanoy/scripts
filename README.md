# scripts

### Why is this here? ###

Everything is very simple. Here are collected and will be collected scripts that somehow and are helping me in my work. They may be developed by me or forked from other authors and improved by appending some new features.
As far as possible, the repository will be supplemented: new scripts will be appeared (maybe not only for shell/bash), and errors in old ones will be fixed.


There are descriptions for developed shell scripts listed below:


File Name  | Description                    | Requirements                    | Notes
----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------
**control_mem.sh**       | Script for restart **supervisorctl** with dependence by memory usage (as percentage) | None | You may modify this script by changing the main command `/usr/bin/supervisorctl restart all` on your own command 
**backup.sh**       |  Script for backup **MongoDB** databases with compression | On the same dir where backup script located you need to create config.txt with following syntax: `user_for_dbconnection:ip_address:port:database_name` | You may modify this script for another DB
test   | test | test | test
