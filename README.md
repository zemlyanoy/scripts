# scripts

### Why is this here? ###

Everything is very simple. Here are collected and will be collected scripts that somehow and are helping me in my work. They may be developed by me or forked from other authors and improved by appending some new features.
As far as possible, the repository will be supplemented: new scripts will be appeared (maybe not only for shell/bash), and errors in old ones will be fixed.


There are descriptions for developed shell scripts listed below:

File  | Description
----------------|----------------------
**control_mem.sh**  | Script for restart **supervisorctl** with dependence by memory usage (as percentage)
